rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_cathay_caravan	false	A lonely Caravan has been spotted trundling through nearby land, bearing the banners of Cathay. No doubt the products of the so-called Celestial Empire would be worth snatching for ourselves, yet such spoils are not likely to lie unguarded.\n\nA choice between killing or caution. It seems the answer is clear...	Convoy Encounter! Cathay Caravan	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_dwarfs	false	A wandering Convoy of our weak-willed former kin has stumbled into our lands. Their very presence here is an offence to the Father of Darkness, one that should be wiped away with blood! Now, do we slaughter them all or massacre them? Annihilation perhaps? So many choices...	Convoy Encounter! A Dwarf Too Far	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_far_from_home	false	Signs of a troop column have been spotted ahead. Judging by the tracks, it looks as though this force has been moving without sleep or pause. Cresting the next hill, the gleam of bone and gold can be seen throughout the army. A host of Tomb Kings, richly adorned, is marching through this area. Their destination is unclear, but their opulence is not. We could descend upon them, and claim their riches for ourselves!	Convoy Encounter! Unceasing March	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_fresh_battlefield	false	An eager tribe of half-brained Hobgoblins have appeared from seemingly nowhere, intending to offer their services; Hashut only knows where they were hiding! Despite their frankly annoying enthusiasm, their blades could come in handy... or perhaps you could make use of this 'blessing' they keep rambling on about...	Convoy Encounter! Hobgoblin Tribute	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_hungry_daemons	false	Traversing realms is hungry work if these Daemons we've encountered are to be believed. You could choose to sate their gluttonous appetites in the hopes of avoiding a fight. Yet, on the other hand, death would solve their hunger too…	Convoy Encounter! Hungry Daemons	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_localised_elfs	false	Unfortunate wretches of many races toil amid the poisoned air and burning ash of the Dark Lands. Yet while out on assignment, even our Convoy knows not to pass up the opportunity to attain more of the "right tools" for the job, having encountered a High Elf host from whom much profit could be forcibly reaped – both in long-limbed Labourers and loot reaped from beardless corpses.	Convoy Encounter! Elfy Profits	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_offence_or_defence	false	A Hobgoblin Wolf Raider is being readied to ride out with a resupply of improved Hell-Forge Armoury surplus for the Convoy. While ensuring he delivers as much as his scrawny frame can carry, we also need to decide which equipment will give the Convoy the greatest chance of successfully repelling any threats.	Convoy Encounter! Hell-Forge in a Handbasket	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_ogre_mercenaries	false	The strength of an Ogre is unmatched anywhere! At least, that's what this group of rotund mercenaries assured us when offering to guard our trade Convoy on its route. Though the might of the Dawi-Zharr no doubt puts their claim to shame, the extra muscle wouldn't go amiss. Ogres' services, however, certainly would not come free of charge.	Convoy Encounter! Ogre Mercenaries	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_1	false	While traveling through a maze of chaotic passages, our Convoy has encountered a mysterious looking portal, simply begging for further exploration. Both rewards and dangers could lie beyond its swirling vortex; is such a risk worth taking?	Convoy Encounter! Portals	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_2	false	Beyond the portal lay a bounty of Cargo, ripe for repossession. If someone was willing to leave it in the open like that, then surely nobody will miss it... except, of course, for the angry Daemons that greeted us upon our return, who demanded the return of their stolen horde.\n\nWe could fight to keep it, though simply returning it may grant an even greater reward...	Convoy Encounter! Portals Again	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_3_a	false	Who needs Cargo when you can secure the services of a party of vicious Daemons? On your generous return of the loot, two groups step forward, offering to rip your enemies into tiny, bloodstained pieces. Delightful! The bickering and chest-pounding that ensues between the groups is less pleasing. It seems you're going to have to choose...	Convoy Encounter! Portals: The Final Chapter	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_power_overwhelming	false	Without warning, a chasm in the earth spontaneously appears in front of the Convoy forming a gaping mouth of razor-sharp teeth. A torrent of whispers floods the heads of the warriors, all repeating the same thing.\n\n[[i]]"Feed me, and overwhelming power shall be yours…"[[/i]]	Convoy Encounter! One Maw for the Road	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_quick_way_down	false	A painstaking section of your Convoy’s route has required the cavalcade to lumber up an unexpectedly steep mountain, putting it behind schedule. Once reaching the pinnacle, the Convoy Master scouts a quicker route down the other side which would make up for the lost time. Given the sheer weight of the Convoy’s consignment, however, the shortcut would make for a perilous descent which may result in some damaged goods.	Convoy Encounter! A Quick Way Down	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_rats_in_a_tunnel	false	This route is endless! Our beleaguered Convoy has been traveling for what seems like forever, with no end in sight. Surely a detour through subterranean tunnels would get our goods to their destination sooner? The pernicious Skaven, however, may have something to say about it...	Convoy Encounter! Rats in a Tunnel	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_redeadify	false	Fog has descended around our Convoy. The smell is putrid and shuffling shapes can be glimpsed in the haze. This land around us teems with their shambling forms; we have stumbled, unwittingly, into the domain of the Undead. These creatures can be confronted head-on and the wretches put down for good or, alternatively, we can order some of our number to distract them while we make our escape, though they will ultimately have no hope against the necrotic masses.	Convoy Encounter! Skulking Horde	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_ambush	false	Stealth is possibly not the strong suit of our would-be ambushers, who visibly await our Convoy from some rather questionable 'hiding' places. We could avoid them easily, of course, but it almost seems a disservice not to show them what a true ambush looks like...	Convoy Encounter! The Ambush	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_guide	false	A guide has tracked down our Convoy, offering to lead the way to our destination in exchange for a reasonable donation to his pockets. His price is frankly extortionate, but as they say in business, time is of the essence.	Convoy Encounter! The Guide	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	false	A cacophony of roars and feral shrieks rings out ahead of your Convoy – a Dark Elf Beastmaster approaches! By the look of his shackled beasts, he is recently returned from an expedition into Norsca and poses little threat, his retinue of hunters visibly weary and battered from their run-ins with the Northmen and critters of the tundra. With a tired Druchii sneer, he offers the Convoy one of his creatures in exchange for some supplies. Though we care little for the Dark Elf’s plight, such a beast could be useful against future threats.	Convoy Encounter! The Beastmaster	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_training_camp	false	The day may have just begun, but one of the scouts has already spotted a wide, flat, stone platform in an isolated area. A series of eight steps leads to an eight-sided arena, with grooves carved in the floor to drain the blood spilled. Unmistakably, this is a Khornate combat shrine: the perfect location to tutor troops and beat the weakness out of them.	Convoy Encounter! Duelling Shrine	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_way_of_lava	false	A recent eruption has created an unexpected opportunity for our Convoy; a land bridge of semi-molten rock, interspersed with fissures of lava and caustic gasses. We can traverse this rough, burning landscape and reach our destination sooner, but the heat may take the lives of some of our weaker personnel.	Convoy Encounter! The Path of Fire	cst/legendary_pirate_attacks	false	Event	UI_CAM_EVENT_Dilemma		event_caravan_neutral.png	false
hkrul_mar_dil_1	false	{{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:CharacterTargetName}}, leader of the {{CcoCampaignEventDilemma:FirstTargetFactionNameWithIcon}} tribe has been defeated; a once powerful warlord now reduced to obscurity beneath your might. For as you stand tall in victory he kneels at your side, hands in chains, his followers stood amongst yours, brought to a halt in anticipation of your next utterance. His men now see him as weak and unfit to lead any longer, this is a chance for you to take control of this faction's forces and land, as well as its followers' dubious loyalty.\n\nThough, while the allure of land may appear to make this choice a simple one, do not let the challenges that a larger empire creates escape you - perhaps simply killing this man and letting whatever is left of his faction fade into memory may be a more fitting end...
