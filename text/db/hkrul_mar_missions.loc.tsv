missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_conquer_empire	The Merchant Emperor	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_conquer_empire	One does not need to bolster military might and prowess to expand influence. By plotting, clawing and scheming the true director feels the ultimate goal is drawing near. Supreme economical rule over the Empire. If we manage to take over Altdorf, either via diplomacy or by funding rebels - we can absorb the military might bolstered by Reikland. The one thing we lack.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_conquer_marien	Conquer Marienburg	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_conquer_marien	This so called Free City is more than a nuisance at this point. The influence of the directorate is starting to spread and even some of the other elector counts are starting to sound like Van de Kuyper's footmen. Bribed by him, surely. If they refuse to listen, they will have to feel our military might. It's time restore the province of Westerland, and absorb whatever military Marienburg has in the process.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_conquer_beichai	Conquer Beichai	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_conquer_beichai	The voices.. They are telling me to go North. Yet the trade we seek to establish is in Hanyu to our West. Somehow, the urge to follow this new destiny is stronger than rationality. I feel this path unlocks my true faith.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_war_on_empire	The Wasteland under threat	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_war_on_empire	The Marienburger oligarchs are corrupt, lazy - easy to manipulate. Easily bribed. But now Reikland threatens the Wasteland. Those ignorant mortal fools. If they rule with their iron grip our ventures will be increasingly harder to manage. That will not happen, instead - they shall fear the wrath of Mundvard the Cruel.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_cousin_alliance	Long lost Relatives	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_cousin_alliance	It seems cousin Vlad has left the safe walls of his lair and has dusted off this boring ambition of ruling over all the Empire. Surely he has not forgotten about his long lost cousin, right? And surely he would benefit from family ruling over the Wasteland.	false
missions_localised_title_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_6	House Van Haagen	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_6	House van Haagen is the second wealthiest of the Ten. Its mansion is in Goudberg on the edge of Zijdemarkt, and its symbol is a shield of blue and white chevrons, unadorned. Leo's heir is his son, Crispijn, 35. Their wealth is a mystery to many, as they don't have nearly the market share of trade that reflects it. This raises eyebrows and the suspision their wealth finds smuggling at it's source. Van Haagen is at wit's end, as appeareantly his cash flow has halted. Not naming any names, our birds whisper that his own son - vital in the Van Haagen's smuggling ring, has been captured in Port Reaver.	false
missions_localised_title_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_7	House Van Onderzoeker	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_7	The van Onderzoekers concentrate on the continental trade, with extensive interests in the Empire, Kislev, Norsca and northern Bretonnia. Thijs inherited a damaged position from his father, who lacked the family's traditional business savvy. House van Onderzoeker is heavily in debt, with many of its holdings mortgaged. If they are to retain their seat at the table at all, they need some positive result. Perhaps with a little interference we can save their seat and indebt young Thijs in the process.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_embassy	The Cathayan Embassy	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_embassy	Master Tsien-Tsin has infiltrated the Cathayan Embassy in Marienburg, yet observant eyes suspect Tzeentch's influence. If we can safely extract the ambassador, he may proof valueable in our eternal mission here in the lands of the far East. He can escape through one of our convoys passing through Marienburg, or we send one of our skilled agents to extract him.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_bridge_reik	Bridge over the River Reik?	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_bridge_reik	A recent edict invoked by Reikland has proven a real eyesore. Trade regulations along the River Reik has severaly hampered our convoys to travel land inwards towards Altdorf, Bechafen, Nuln and the other great cities. Our Riverwardens operating from Schildersheim are forced out by the Eilhart office of Trade Equity. We have to plot something cunning and end this, or our trade will take a massive blow. Perhaps bribing a few rebels might help.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_araby_brethern	Arabyan Brethern	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_araby_brethern	Your new asset provides some valueable information on a trader operating in Araby, across the sea in the Al-Haikk Region. Right before boarding on Margritta, this man spoke about Pieter de Groot. Claiming that if Hakim has the chance, he should relay that Ibin Al-Suliman has valueable information for the directorate when consulted.	false
missions_localised_title_rhox_mar_exiled_chieftain	The Exiled Chieftain	false
missions_localised_description_rhox_mar_exiled_chieftain	Along one of his many journeys, Pieter de Groot befriended a exiled Northern Chieftain. After besting him in a battle that took place on the hard waves of the Sea of Claws. The now Exiled Chieftain is said to have landed on Empiric shores, somehwere in the Wrecker's Point region. His knowledge of Norscan tribes might proof valueable. We can recruit him for Pieter's retinue.	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_hendrik1	"Understand this. We are at war with Chaos. The Elder races are corrupt and dying, which leaves Humanity as the world's only hope. But Mankind's strength lies in its purity - we can afford no weakening taint. Your vile corruption weakens us all, signor, and so you must die. Nothing personal." \\n\\n â€”The Sword of Solkan \\n\\n The agent of purity, Champion of Solkan, Vigilante against the foul - is ready to join your cause as the everlasting threat of chaos is glooming larger and larger.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_1	The family Van den Nijmenk is famous for the many unique and wondrous items it brings back from its explorations, each of which commands a fabulous price when sold. While on a failed expedition to find the lost Norse Dwarfhold of Karaz Krogmort, Sasha made a small fortune from his discovery of an ancient High Elf orrery, with mechanisms of gold and planets of exquisite crystal. Sasha could not resist attempting a second expiditon, and recent reports tell you he's failed again. Stranded in a far away Dwarven hold, a simple extraction would not only ensure his everlasting support, it might also persuade him to hand over any artifacts he discovered.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_2	Clotilde Roelef is the only director of old Westerlandic nobility, and the hardest of the bunch to deal with. Her weak spot is her heir and niece, Clara de Roelef, who goes nowhere without her Arabyan bodyguard, Hakim. Clotilde did not expect this to be vice-versa however, as recently her heir has left with Hakim to marry in the Arabyan city of Al-Haikk. Not only is this a disgrace for old nobility like the De Roelef's, it also leaves House De Roelef heirless. Little birds tell us they are in the Estalian City of Margritta awaiting passage to Al-Haikk. If we send a agent to and bring Clara home, House De Roelef would be in our debt indefinitely. And who knows, we might find use for the Arabyan Guardian yet.	false

missions_localised_title_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_2	House De Roelef	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_3	House Winkler was once the strongest family of the ten, but they're power and wealth came to a rather unfortunate ending. The Van de Kuypers quite literally bullied them out of existence. It was Jaan himself who pushed Grandfather Winkler into the canals after Winkler had lost his shirt over Ostlander pork bellies. One of the founders of the Directorate, Winkler died a broken alcoholic in Suiddock. Their family name still resembles something however, and they're influence all be it small could be of value. Who else could destroy a house and build it back up again? Sounds like trademark Van de Kuypers. Perhaps we can give them a small portion of iron and beer production, to compete with those pesky dwarves of Clan Fooger.	false

missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_4	Headed by Maximilian Rothemuur, 66, House Rothemuur concentrates on the Araby and New World trade. The former has placed them in direct competition with House de Roelef, while the latter trade is conducted in alliance with House van de Kuypers. The Rothemuurs also have particularly close contacts with the High Elves, and consequently obtain many valuable goods from the New World. Lately however, they are loosing this trade-war with the De Roelef's, with the matriarch Clotilde sealing several high-valued trade arrangements with the inhabitans of Ulthuan. Maximilian needs you to mediate with the inhabitants of Lothern, to ensure their position within the New World market and consolidate the Rothemuur's vote. 	false

missions_localised_title_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_4	House Rothemuur	false
missions_localised_description_hkrul_mar_jk_follower_5	The oldest man of the directorate is the Patriach of the Van Scheldt family, the grey-haired Wessel van Scheldt is well over 80-years old. Although they are already allied to the Van de Kuypers, their power is diminishing as Van Scheldt rarely appears outside the walls of his fortified mansion. So paranoid is Wessel van Scheldt about the "low-life scum" that are his neighbours that he refuses to travel the streets of Marienburg and only travels via canal-boat. In order to gain his vote it is best to help ease his paranoid mind by simply removing that which troubles him: Enemies. If we demonstrate the power of our military fist it will ensure the Van Scheldt's crawl behind our backs and swords. Slowly taking over their grip on Marienburg's fishing trade in the process, of course.	false
