dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_dwarfs	A wandering Convoy of Dwarf has entered our site. Should we attack them for a fresh new set of slaves?	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_far_from_home	Convoy Encounter! Unceasing March	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_far_from_home	Signs of a troop column have been spotted ahead. Judging by the tracks, it looks as though this force has been moving without sleep or pause. Cresting the next hill, the gleam of bone and gold can be seen throughout the army. A host of Tomb Kings, richly adorned, is marching through this area. Their destination is unclear, but their opulence is not. We could descend upon them, and claim their riches for ourselves!	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_hungry_daemons	Traversing realms is hungry work if these Daemons we've encountered are to be believed. You could choose to sate their gluttonous appetites in the hopes of avoiding a fight. Yet, on the other hand, death would solve their hunger too…	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_localised_elfs	Unfortunate wretches of many races travel the sea to gather wealth. Yet while out on assignment, even our Convoy knows not to pass up the opportunity to attain more of the "right tools" for the job, having encountered a High Elf host from whom much profit could be forcibly reaped – both in long-limbed Labourers and loot reaped from beardless corpses.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_offence_or_defence	Convoy Encounter! Dark Magic Artifcat	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_offence_or_defence	A great artifact of dark magic has come to our grasp. However, we need to decide which equipment we should empower to give the Convoy the greatest chance of successfully repelling any threats.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_ogre_mercenaries	The strength of an Ogre is unmatched anywhere! At least, that's what this group of rotund mercenaries assured us when offering to guard our trade Convoy on its route. Their claim is ridiculous but the extra muscle wouldn't go amiss. Ogres' services, however, certainly would not come free of charge.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_1	Convoy Encounter! Portals	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_1	While traveling through a maze of chaotic passages, our Convoy encountered a mysterious-looking portal, simply begging for further exploration.

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_2	Beyond the portal lay a bounty of Cargo, ripe for repossession.

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_3_a	Who needs Cargo when you can secure the services of a party of vicious Daemons? On your generous return of the loot, two groups step forward, offering to rip your enemies into tiny, bloodstained pieces. Delightful! The bickering and chest-pounding that ensues between the groups is less pleasing. It seems you're going to have to choose...	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_rats_in_a_tunnel	This ship is filled with rats! Unless we have dealt with them sooner or we will have to make a stop to refill our supplies. Maybe we need to track them all and kill them.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_redeadify	Convoy Encounter! Skulking Horde	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_redeadify	Fog has descended around our Convoy. The smell is putrid and shuffling shapes can be glimpsed in the haze. This land around us teems with their shambling forms; we have stumbled, unwittingly, into the domain of the Undead. These creatures can be confronted head-on and the wretches put down for good or, alternatively, we can order some of our number to distract them while we make our escape, though they will ultimately have no hope against the necrotic masses.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_ambush	Convoy Encounter! The Ambush	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_ambush	Stealth is possibly not the strong suit of our would-be ambushers, who visibly await our Convoy from some rather questionable 'hiding' places. We could avoid them easily, of course, but it almost seems a disservice not to show them what a true ambush looks like...	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_guide	Convoy Encounter! The Guide	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_guide	A guide has tracked down our Convoy, offering to lead the way to our destination in exchange for a reasonable donation to his pockets. His price is frankly extortionate, but as they say in business, time is of the essence.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	Convoy Encounter! The Beastmaster	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	A cacophony of roars and feral shrieks rings out ahead of your Convoy – a Dark Elf Beastmaster approaches! By the look of his shackled beasts, he is recently returned from an expedition into Norsca and poses little threat, his retinue of hunters visibly weary and battered from their run-ins with the Northmen and critters of the tundra. With a tired Druchii sneer, he offers the Convoy one of his creatures in exchange for some slaves. Though we care little for the Dark Elf’s plight, such a beast could be useful against future threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_training_camp	Convoy Encounter! Duelling Shrine	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_training_camp	The day may have just begun, but one of the scouts has already spotted a wide, flat, stone platform in an isolated area. A series of eight steps leads to an eight-sided arena, with grooves carved in the floor to drain the blood spilled. Unmistakably, this is a Khornate combat shrine: the perfect location to tutor troops and beat the weakness out of them.	false
