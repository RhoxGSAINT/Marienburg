building_short_description_texts_short_description_hkrul_mar_suiddock	"Suiddock is the heart and soul of Marienburg — and considering what a run-down pesthole it is, that's a frightening thought."\\n\\n The Bruynwater canal is one of the few waterways in Marienburg deep enough to handle ocean-going vessels. It runs for almost a mile, both sides crammed with warehouses, docks, offices, shops, taverns, flophouses, shipyards, tenements and brothels. Its streets are filled with crowds of people always in motion, all Marienburg's classes and races blending together in an ever-changing swirl. The Bruynwater itself and its many side canals teem with ships large and small, from sea-going clippers, caravels, ketches and dhows to riverboats and barges from the interior of the Old World. Amongst them all dash the small dories and skiffs of the locals, darting in and out of the traffic like water-beetles and creating nightmares for pilots trying to bring large vessels into dock. Suiddock is the beating heart of Marienburg's labour, trade, crime and all that the upperclass dislikes being associated with.	true
building_short_description_texts_short_description_hkrul_mar_temple_haeyndrik	"This is efficiency! Where else can you pray and take out a loan at the same time?"\\n\\n The Temple of Haendryk is far grander than one would expect for such a small cult, until one realizes its importance here - along with the cult of Manaan, the cult of Haendryk represents one of the two reasons for the city's prosperity: the sea and commerce. Worshipped elsewhere only by merchants and peddlers, the people of Marienburg have taken the cult's message to heart: "Make money fast!" The temple has been adorned by generations of people grateful for striking it rich or hoping to gain Haendryk's favour, till it rivals the Cathedral of Manaan in splendour. The temple is the centre of the cult of Haendryk in the Old World — indeed, it is by far the largest temple to Haendryk in the Old World and is one of the few holy sites to the god permanently staffed by priests. Cult shrines in most towns and cities are tended by lay-brothers, though priests are sent out on a regular circuit to tend to the faithful and collect tithes.	true
building_short_description_texts_short_description_hkrul_mar_bechai	The worship of Chi'an Chi became popular among the aristocracy of the city of Beichai centuries ago, but as worship is outlawed by the Dragon Emperor, patrons are forced to organize their cult underground. There is no city in Cathay where the worship of Chi'an Chi is as strong and well organized as Beichai. With various shrines hidden throughout the city, all pulling energy from one big monument hidden well underground. 	true
building_short_description_texts_short_description_hkrul_mar_mundvard_liar	For centuries the Knights of Purity have been trying to locate Mundvard's Lair within the underground canals and sewers of Marienburg. Not once did they find a trace, the reason is simple however - as Mundvard is as shrewd as he is Cruel. He houses his lair outside of the City's wall, deep within the mountains. Amongst dead Orcs, Goblins and other foul things. From here he runs is various operations that remain a scourge for the Wasteland.	true
building_short_description_texts_short_description_hkrul_mar_mundvard_marienburg	No longer shall Vampires rule from the shadows of the Wasteland, instead - the once proud Goudberg, vital vein for the Marienburger aristocracy is deduced to darkness, long blood stained banners waving from tall abandoned estates. Here Mundvard rains supreme, from his palace in Paleisbuurt, over both men and undead a like.	true
building_short_description_texts_short_description_hkrul_mar_rijker	"Every time I sail into this bay, the first thing I see is that prison, like a watchman guarding his master's jewels. And I can't decide if Rijker's stands guard against the foreign invader or against the Marienburgers' own worst selves."\\n\\n Fortress, prison and palace to some. Rijker's Isle is a towering island situated directly between Marienburg's vulnerable port and the dangerous Sea of Claws. It is not only instrumental for Marienburg's defence, as no ship shall pass it's ordnance's gaze, it is also one of the largest prisons of the Old World. Housing the most descipeable criminals. Among the garrison are the Red Talons, a Tilean mercenary band hired to perform executions via firing line and fend off any foreign invaders approaching Marienburg from the Sea.	true

building_short_description_texts_short_description_rhox_mar_foreign_income_1	Although authorities will notice more and more people dissapear under the cover of night, a few bribes will go a long way in maintaining our operations.	false
building_short_description_texts_short_description_rhox_mar_foreign_trade_1	Mortal men serve a variety of purposes, much like cattle - they are as valueable for consumption as they are for trade.	false
building_short_description_texts_short_description_rhox_mar_eilhart	One of the vital hubs in regulating trade over the River Reik, Eilhart is located at the very entry way that enables passage from the Sea of Claws to to all major cities of the Empire. It is from this franchise the edicts are invoked. The Rivermen association from Marienburg thus states: ''Control the Rivers, control the Empire''. It is also the home of the largest cohort of Riverwardens, the soldiers responsible for enforcing laws and edicts upon the Rivers.	true
