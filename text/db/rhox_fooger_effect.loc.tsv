ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_fooger_sword	The Counting House of Arkat Fooger sits well back from the canal, forming one side of a small plaza with churches to Haendryk and Verena to the right and left of it. Hundreds of people from all levels of society pass through the plaza each day, rushing from one deal to the next. Dozens of them make for the great double doors of "De Oud Foogershuis", built of imported oak and guarded night and day by four axe-wielding Dwarfs wearing the livery of the House of Fooger. Infused with Dwarven runic powers the Key to House Fooger unlocks a door clearly imported from the deep mines of Dwarven holds of old. It's power unleashes a mighty smite. Arkat rarely let's the key out of his sight, having a somewhat unhealthy obsession with it.	true
