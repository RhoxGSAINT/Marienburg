unit_description_historical_texts_text_hkrul_jk	Jaan van de Kuypers is reputedly the richest man in the world, he became the head of the family when his elder brother, Bertold, went insane and slaughtered their parents and sister. The truth of this event is more sinister however, as Jaan made a sacrifice to Khorne, summoning a bloodthirster who he ordered to murder his parents. He blamed Bertold all so he could inheret the entire estate. Now, he counts among his personal friends the Tsar of Kislev, the King of Bretonnia, the Sultan of Araby and even Emperor Karl Franz and the Electors. All of them owe him money. He is the true leader of the Directorate: through his web of clients and contacts. The family has the broadest interests of any of the Ten, ranging from Averlander corn to medicinals from Cathay. Jaan van de Kuypers takes a personal interest in the Lustrian trade. The family mansion is in Goudberg, almost connected to the New Palace. Their symbol is a carmine shield divided into three parts: fist topmost, then a gold coin and a quill.	true
