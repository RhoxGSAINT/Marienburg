dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_1A	Your guides tell us there is an unusual ocean current we can use that is safer and quicker, but such precious information will not be cheap to obtain. A small share of the convoy's profits will no doubt ease their tongues...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_1B	There are rumors of a quicker way through the reefs to ensure the merchandise reaches the markets quicker, but to turn rumor into reality, the guides demand a share of the profits.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_2A	You spot a shipwreck alongside the sea lane. The original occupants are nowhere to be seen. Yet, surprisingly, there is a good amount of cargo still inside.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_2B	A rival's convoy is spotted, shattered to pieces leaving only a few left flotsams behind. There are no signs of the lost crew – "enslaved" is the guides' guess. However, there is cargo in the debris; all agree it's best to take what can be carried and move on.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_3A	As the convoy comes to a halt for the night, a stranger in a lifeboat closes in. He's begging you to take him with you and saying he'll pay the price by protecting the convoys	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_3B	A small boat approaches while you are resting. The stranger claims he is a famed adventurer and wishes to join the convoy's retinue! He will protect and fight, but his services come at a price!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_4A	The convoy ship stumbles upon a patrol of allies that have been lost for some time. The guides can show them a way back to friendly regions, although this will cause a short delay in getting the Caravan to its destination.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_4B	The convoy ship was being tracked… followed. After moving into a defensive stance and loading the cannon, the potential enemies emerged and turned out to be friends – a group of mercenaries who have fought alongside and spilled blood with you in the past; more like friends than mere colleagues, in fact.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_5	A convoy ship draped in the trappings of Ind travels this road. It slows to a stop as your own approaches. Growls come from the guards whose faces remain hidden by voluminous silk scarfs, their gloved hands hover over large scimitars resting on their hips. One infers that the Merchant Lord should approach. He does so cautiously and sees a large cage hidden behind fine curtains.\\n\\nThe Merchant Lord returns, his eyes gleaming, for he has seen what lies in the cage. Yet he won't say what... only that Ind is known as the Land of a Thousand Gods for a reason.\\n\\n"We are blessed," he stammers.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_battle_1A	Up ahead, pirates have set up a trap, waiting in a defensive position. Pirates are demanding cargo from your convoy ship as a toll to continue. Refuse and they will attack.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_battle_2A	Your scouts have discovered a pirates preparing an ambush. There is an alternative route, but it will add days to the journey. Or, perhaps, without the element of surprise, the enemy can be beaten and the Gilded Route won't incur a delay?	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_battle_2B	Pathfinders have scouted ahead and discovered an ambush is being set. There is another sea lane that will veer us away from danger, but delay the Gilded Route's arrival. The other option is to take the convoy ship along the original route, repel the ambushers, and arrive on time.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_battle_3	A pirate ship approaches our ship and they're not open for negotiations. They're demanding all or nothing. If we want to avoid the battle, we must leave someone as a rearguard in a small ship and their chance of survival is low. 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_cth_caravan_battle_4	A rift tears through reality and Daemons disgorge, hungry for mortal souls. They quickly catch the scent of the convoy ship and give chase. The only escape is to sacrifice some defenders and hope they can fend off the Daemons while the rest flee. Or, if you wish to retain your honour – stay your ground, and face the Daemons!	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_confederation_dilemma	Distraught, disillusioned, banktrupt. The once great House Den Euwe has gambled and lost their final wealth as their pride and heir, Egmond den Euwe, failed to capatilize on the Cathayan Market. For once, the Van de Kuypers need do nothing to neutralise a rival house but watch as they implode. But as in all things we see opportunity in others misfortune. For a fee we could pay off the debts racked up by House Den Euwe and take over their trade mission in the far East. Although there's something inherently off about Egmond, he has skill and could proof valuable.	true

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_ultimatum_dilemma	Long has there been a stalemate between the Directorate and the Shadows of the Wasteland, as in truth they are equally corrupt. As long as those who disappear from Marienburg in to the clutches of the Shadows are of low class society, the directors hardly care. But now the mortal man of Marienburg have grown arrogant. Thinking their own rings and networks can take over the lucrative trade. They are demanding blood money, as always these shortminded fools tend to solve everything with a few silverlings.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_egmond_choose_side	Egmond's voice, even his very body slowly begins to transform. His erratic demeanour no longer attributable to sickness, the people arround him know there is something deeply off with him. Forcing them along on his quest ordered by Tsien-Tsin to travel to North Egmond now faces the true moment that shall define his faith. \\n\\n Tsien-Tsin, or as is clear now - Tzeentch, orders him to rendezvous with the cunning Vilitch the Curseling. May they together dip Cathay in everlasting conversion. Yet somewhere, deep down Egmond still has the urge to resist. The spirit of his Nipponese ancestors pushing towards the light, and Tsien-Tsin out. It is time to pick your faith.	false

dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_dilemma_burgerhof	Master-Speaker of the Burgerhof	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_burgerhof	The Master Speaker of the Burgerhof is a populist, a demagogue and corrupt. Yet his talent with words and speeches has gained him the support of most of the lower-class society. They see in him one of their own kind and class. Little do they know, the Speaker only seeks power and money and a seat among those his own supporters despise. He's made a daring yet threatening proposal, offering his services and thus the support of his following for a price. 	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_dilemma_final_reward	Drawn by the prospect of wealth and adventure, mercenaries and guildsmen are willing to join the convoy. The Merchant Lords background has played a part in the type of mercenaries willing to join your ranks. We should choose wisely by bolstering the convoy where it is weakest. 	false

dilemmas_localised_description_hkrul_mar_dil_1	The great Empire of Man exists as little more than a pack of squabbling animals, power-hungry Electors and their backwards peoples desperate to better themselves at the cost of their neighbors. None would admit to betraying their Emperor, of course. But in every one of their rancid hearts lies one simple thought - "I could rule better." A seed that, if watered and nurtured, can grow into something great and terrible.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_cathay_caravan	A lonely Caravan has been spotted trundling through nearby land, bearing the banners of Cathay. No doubt the products of the so-called Celestial Empire would be worth snatching for ourselves, yet such spoils are not likely to lie unguarded.\\n\\nA choice between killing or caution. It seems the answer is clear...	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_dwarfs	Convoy Encounter! A Dwarf Too Far	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_dwarfs	A wandering Convoy of Dwarf has entered our site. Should we attack them for a fresh new set of slaves?	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_far_from_home	Convoy Encounter! Unceasing March	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_far_from_home	Signs of a troop column have been spotted ahead. Judging by the tracks, it looks as though this force has been moving without sleep or pause. Cresting the next hill, the gleam of bone and gold can be seen throughout the army. A host of Tomb Kings, richly adorned, is marching through this area. Their destination is unclear, but their opulence is not. We could descend upon them, and claim their riches for ourselves!	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_fresh_battlefield	It seems like there was a big battle nearby, we can use it to raise more troops or use its magical power to empower the troops. 	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_hungry_daemons	Convoy Encounter! Hungry Daemons	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_hungry_daemons	Traversing realms is hungry work if these Daemons we've encountered are to be believed. You could choose to sate their gluttonous appetites in the hopes of avoiding a fight. Yet, on the other hand, death would solve their hunger too…	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_localised_elfs	Convoy Encounter! Elfy Profits	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_localised_elfs	Unfortunate wretches of many races travel the sea to gather wealth. Yet while out on assignment, even our Convoy knows not to pass up the opportunity to attain more of the "right tools" for the job, having encountered a High Elf host from whom much profit could be forcibly reaped – both in long-limbed Labourers and loot reaped from beardless corpses.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_offence_or_defence	Convoy Encounter! Dark Magic Artifcat	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_offence_or_defence	A great artifact of dark magic has come to our grasp. However, we need to decide which equipment we should empower to give the Convoy the greatest chance of successfully repelling any threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_ogre_mercenaries	Convoy Encounter! Ogre Mercenaries	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_ogre_mercenaries	The strength of an Ogre is unmatched anywhere! At least, that's what this group of rotund mercenaries assured us when offering to guard our trade Convoy on its route. Their claim is ridiculous but the extra muscle wouldn't go amiss. Ogres' services, however, certainly would not come free of charge.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_1	Convoy Encounter! Portals	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_1	While traveling through a maze of chaotic passages, our Convoy encountered a mysterious-looking portal, simply begging for further exploration. Both rewards and dangers could lie beyond its swirling vortex; is such a risk worth taking?	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_2	Convoy Encounter! Portals Again	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_2	Beyond the portal lay a bounty of Cargo, ripe for repossession. If someone was willing to leave it in the open like that, then surely nobody will miss it... except, of course, for the angry Daemons that greeted us upon our return, who demanded the return of their stolen horde.\\n\\nWe could fight to keep it, though simply returning it may grant an even greater reward...	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_3_a	Convoy Encounter! Portals: The Final Chapter	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_portals_part_3_a	Who needs Cargo when you can secure the services of a party of vicious Daemons? On your generous return of the loot, two groups step forward, offering to rip your enemies into tiny, bloodstained pieces. Delightful! The bickering and chest-pounding that ensues between the groups is less pleasing. It seems you're going to have to choose...	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_power_overwhelming	Without warning, a sudden chill rushes through the bones.

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_quick_way_down	The Convoy Master scouts a quicker route which would make up for the lost time. However, looking at the weather, that shortcut would result in some damaged 'goods'.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_rats_in_a_tunnel	This ship is filled with rats! Unless we have dealt with them sooner or we will have to make a stop to refill our supplies. Maybe we need to track them all and kill them.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_redeadify	Convoy Encounter! Skulking Horde	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_redeadify	Fog has descended around our Convoy. The smell is putrid and shuffling shapes can be glimpsed in the haze. This land around us teems with their shambling forms; we have stumbled, unwittingly, into the domain of the Undead. These creatures can be confronted head-on and the wretches put down for good or, alternatively, we can order some of our number to distract them while we make our escape, though they will ultimately have no hope against the necrotic masses.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_ambush	Convoy Encounter! The Ambush	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_ambush	Stealth is possibly not the strong suit of our would-be ambushers, who visibly await our Convoy from some rather questionable 'hiding' places. We could avoid them easily, of course, but it almost seems a disservice not to show them what a true ambush looks like...	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_guide	Convoy Encounter! The Guide	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_the_guide	A guide has tracked down our Convoy, offering to lead the way to our destination in exchange for a reasonable donation to his pockets. His price is frankly extortionate, but as they say in business, time is of the essence.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	Convoy Encounter! The Beastmaster	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	A cacophony of roars and feral shrieks rings out ahead of your Convoy – a Dark Elf Beastmaster approaches! By the look of his shackled beasts, he is recently returned from an expedition into Norsca and poses little threat, his retinue of hunters visibly weary and battered from their run-ins with the Northmen and critters of the tundra. With a tired Druchii sneer, he offers the Convoy one of his creatures in exchange for some slaves. Though we care little for the Dark Elf’s plight, such a beast could be useful against future threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_training_camp	Convoy Encounter! Duelling Shrine	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_mar_mundvard_dilemma_training_camp	The day may have just begun, but one of the scouts has already spotted a wide, flat, stone platform in an isolated area. A series of eight steps leads to an eight-sided arena, with grooves carved in the floor to drain the blood spilled. Unmistakably, this is a Khornate combat shrine: the perfect location to tutor troops and beat the weakness out of them.	false
