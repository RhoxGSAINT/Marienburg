ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_arbatt_trident	Captain Walblatt is a well-known member of the Knights Mariner, and tales of his exploits are told throughout the coastal regions of the Old World. It is not prowess in battle or devotion that these legends tell of, but of the quest Walblatt has tirelessly devoted himself to for nigh on a decade. For the past nine years, since the last, ill-fated voyage of the templar warship, Manannâ€™s Trident, of which Walblatt is the only survivor, he has hunted the great red Chaos whale that wrecked his ship, swallowed his Trident and killed his crewmates. Unscathed and spotless, the Trident emerges from the bested Whale's stomach. Surely this is a gift by Manann himself.	false
