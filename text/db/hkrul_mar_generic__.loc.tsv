ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_anc_araby	The various trading missions employed by House Van de Kuypers led them to the far corners of the World. One of the places they managed to get a foothold is the wonderous city of Al-Haikk, a Arabyan tradehub famed for it's exotic wares. To consolidate a market share there Jaan van de Kuypers did what he does best: Bribe people. So too this ambitious Arabyan trader, tasked with mapping trade opportunities deep within the Arabyan Desert. Pieter de Groot was tasked to make sure this trader complies with the Van de Kuypers wishes, and keep him in his close retinue.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_anc_stadsraad	The Merchant Houses of Marienburg agreed to have one of the Directorate elected Staadtholder, to act as regent "until a true heir to the House of van de Maacht can be found". Of course, no heir has ever been found. The Directorate is careful to see that no one can meet the conditions. The Staadtholder is ''chosen'' each year from among the Directors, which usually comes down to the Director with the deepest pockets handpicking a candidate. It is no suprise the Staddholder is deep within the Van de Kuypers' pockets. In any case, the Staddtholder is an important figure for the Marienburg society.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_anc_norscan	Merchant vessels face many threats on their travels. None they face sooner however, than the Norscan Raiders scouring the Sea of Claws and thus the entryway to the City-State of Marienburg. When Pieter de Groot was boarded on the ''Goudwind'', a merchant vessel on a trade mission to Ulthuan, he came face to face with a Norscan Raiding Fleet mere days after departing from Marienburg. What saved the ''Goudwind'' was the fact Pieter is as cunning as he is tall. Disregarding the minor Norscan Ships, ''Big Piet'' used his Boarding Hook to take down the mast of the Norscan Chieftain's Raiding Craft, just when it came close. The other ships scrambled at the thought they lost their Chieftain. But Pieter saved him from a sure death, not out of empathy, but out of opportunity. He slowly turned the Norscan, using his knowledge of Norscan Raiding tactics to ensure safe passage for future voyages through the Sea of Claws.	true
ancillaries_onscreen_name_hkrul_mar_anc_sander	Gerardus Hondschoen	true
ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_anc_sander	Brother Gerardus Hondschoen has always enjoyed a challenge - ever since he was a lad in Suiddock, stealing to support his mother, he's relished going into places he shouldn't, taking things that weren't his and doing his best to embarrass the rich and powerful. A locked safe is like tossing down the glove to him, a duel between him and the locksmith. A greedy landlord is someone just begging to have a chamber pot emptied on his head. Gerardus believes Simon Goudenkruin is the key to wealth, using his patrons as willing victims.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_scheldt	House van Scheldt has its headquarters in a fortified compound at the eastern, newer end of Suiddock, its opulence made more striking by the slums that surround it. So paranoid is Wessel van Scheldt about the "low-life scum" that are his neighbours that he has the whitewashed outer wall patrolled by household marines and their dogs. Armed guards check the baskets of servants coming to the estate, even those who have worked there for years. The 80-year-old patriarch never travels Suiddock's streets. Lately, he has only left the house to attend Directorate meetings. House van Scheldt makes its money from fishing. Many of the city's fisherman owe the House money, and others have become employees after having their boats foreclosed for failure to pay their debts. The House is allied with van de Kuypers, Raemerswijk, den Euwe and Rothemuur.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_nijmenk	Sasha van den Nijmenk, 43, doesn't really want to be a Director - he'd much rather be sailing to inspect the family holdings in Kislev or Norsca, or even leading an expedition into uncharted areas of those wild lands. Like all the Ten, van den Nijmenk's provides banking and money-lending services. It's rumoured that the Grand Duke of Middenland is particularly in Sasha's debt. The House also specializes in furs, amber, gems and other products unique to Norsca and Kislev. House van den Nijmenk's private militia is unusual: almost all are Kislevites, retainers of Sasha's maternal relatives, fiercely loyal to the House, and dour and morose except when caught up in a drinking and singing contest in a local tavern.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_fooger	House Winkler was once the strongest family of the ten, but they're power and wealth came to a rather unfortunate ending. The Van de Kuypers quite literally bullied them out of existence. It was Jaan himself who pushed Grandfather Winkler into the canals after Winkler had lost his shirt over Ostlander pork bellies. One of the founders of the Directorate, Winkler died a broken alcoholic in Suiddock. Their family name still resembles something however, and they're influence all be it small could be of value. Who else could destroy a house and build it back up again? Sounds like trademark Van de Kuypers.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_roelef	Clotilde de Roelef is the only female director other than the High Priestess of Shallya. She is also the matriarch of the de Roelef family, the only family of the Wasteland's old nobility to succeed in business. She and her extended family still live in their ancient mansion in Oudgeldwijk and are the de facto speakers for the old nobility who exist there in genteel poverty. Her heir is her niece, Clara de Roelef, 15, who goes nowhere without her Arab bodyguard, Hakim. Clotilde earned her seat on the Directorate fourteen years ago when House Akkerman collapsed in scandal, seven of its elders revealed as Slaanesh cultists. The de Roelefs specialize in luxury imports from Arabia, Tilea and Estalia, and export Imperial cloth, liquors and Wasteland lace.

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_rothemuur	The Rothemuur mansion is in central Goudberg, a palace built in a gaudy Tilean style and decorated with pastel marble and ornate fountains. The family's symbol is a shield with three red dots on a yellow field. Headed by Maximilian Rothemuur, 66, it concentrates on the Arab and New World trade. The former has placed them in direct competition with House de Roelef, while the latter trade is conducted in alliance with House van de Kuypers. While a firm van de Kuypers ally, Maximilian is always looking to increase his House's stature. In his view, you either sink or swim: there's no treading water.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_jk_hat	Paulus van der Maacht was the last Baron of Westerland. He died without heirs whilst serving the Imperial Emperor. All rulers afterwards are simply acting regents "until a true heir to the House of van de Maacht can be found". Of course, the wealthiest families make sure this never happens. The Directorate is careful to see that no one can meet the conditions. Van der Maacht's possessions are instead used as symbolic tokens of power as the wielders derive legitimacy for their influence by calling themselves the owner of items previously wielded by Van der Maacht. The most important and magical of these items was the Ceremonial Hat of Westerland, this luxurious item was wielded by the Elector Count of Westerland. With pompous feathers and gems it is a sight to be hold and it's worth it's weight in gold.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_frost_globe	Sasha made a small fortune from his discovery of an ancient High Elf orrery, with mechanisms of gold and planets of exquisite crystal. Bought by Baron Henryk's College, the device has been the source of academic controversy: while accounting for the Sun, the planets and Mannslieb, there is no crystal that represents Morrslieb, the Chaos moon. Some scholars claim that it comes from a time before the Great Disaster, while most think it is some Norse Dwarf joke and that the College wasted its money. Whatever it is, it seems highly unstable.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_black_cap	Theophilus Graveland came to Marienburg from Kalkaat, a town in Kleinland. He started his career as a bounty hunter, tracking smugglers and pirates who preyed on river traffic. Not because he cared, but because tracking and hunting other people was the only thing he was good at. Almost all his travels led to Marienburg, and to Suiddock. In the time he spent hunting criminals there, he came to know its people and found among them and their vitality something he lacked - something to care about and protect for its own sake, not just for the reward money. And so he became a member of the Black Caps, taking promotions only when they allowed him to stay in Suiddock. He was finally promoted to Watch Captain a few years ago, and has been tireless in guarding the docklands and its people.	true

The Emperor accepted this proposal and so came the end of Noble-rule in Westerland. Atleast untill a true heir of Van der Maacht is to be found.. Untill then, the relics worn by Van der Maacht still hold mythical and mystical value for the Wastelanders. It's wielder the closest resemblance to that what they once had: A ruler.	false

This won't be enough to neutralise the Van Haagen's - but rumour has it they're son has gone missing after a ''trade mission'' to the New World. We all know they are neck-deep in slave trade.  We need to get our hands on Leo's heir, Crispijn. \\n\\nLeo rules his family with an authoritarian hand, "old Leo", 67, has placed young relatives in many cities to oversee family interests, preferring blood-ties to agents' commissions.

Their support won't really mean anything, and it's all due to that drunkard Thijs. He took over the family interests a year ago after the sudden death of his father Rembrand van Onderzoeker, whose body was found floating in a Suiddock canal. An official inquest ruled that the elder van Onderzoeker had drowned after a night of heavy black lotus use, but Thijs has refused to accept this, claiming his father had never taken more than a glass of sherry with his dinner. Refusing to make any public accusations, rumours flew after Thijs refused to shake the hand of Director Leo van Haagen during the last Oath of Manaan ceremony at the start of the trading season.	true

Tough, arrogant and brutal. A sharp negotiator, he has made the Merchant Houses realize that to get anything done on the docks, they have to go through him. He is loyal to those who are loyal to him and ruthless with those who aren't. He deeply loves Suiddock and its people. He has clandestine contacts with most of the Directorate and used to be Big Piet's employer before Jaan van de Kuyper's took interest in Piet's abilities.	true

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_axel	Huurder works hard during the day running his boat and then long hours into the night on Association business. Currently, the Riverman's Association is on bad terms with the other Guilds. The root of the dispute lies in a clause in Admiralty law giving members of the Brotherhood of Seamen and Pilots the right to guide all boats and ships entering or leaving Marienburg harbour, for a fee of 1/- per foot of boat. The Rivermen, all of them experienced and many of them native Wastelanders, resent this because they feel they know the river and harbour as well as any pilot. Many Reik users, whether rivermen or not, claim the Pilots are little better than racketeers, and their power to call on the River Watch to enforce their rights rubs salt in an already open sore.\\n\\n	true

ancillary_sets_description_hkrul_mar_guilds	To effectively control Marienburg, from it's Guilderveld to the Handelaarsmarkt and from Suiddock to Paleisbuurt, one does not only needs to exert control over the oligarchs and pseodo-nobility, no, perhaps more importantly one needs to control the working class. And one does not influence the working class without the direct backing of the Guildmasters and their Guilds, the fora in which the lower classes of Marienburg organize themselves. With the three most important and largest Guilds in the Van der Kuyper's backpocket, control over the Cities lower class should be no issue.\\n\\n	false

ancillaries_colour_text_hkrul_mar_speaker	The Burgerhof is a rowdy chamber in which are represented all the city's guilds and aldermen elected by the householders of the city's wards and the major Wasteland towns. It meets more frequently, and its sessions are marked by sharp debates and even fist-fights.The Burgerhof's leader is Speaker Nieut Gyngrijk, a firebrand demagogue especially popular with the working classes. He is the consummate mass-politician. He rose from a middle-class family in Noordmuur and quickly gained a reputation as a firebrand orator for the rights of the working man in Marienburg's courts. But he is not an idealist - rather, he desires power and money. Since his birth denied him the advantages of the rich, he pragmatically created his own power base: the resentful and unsophisticated who seek to blame others for their own troubles. His success brought him to the attention of the Directorate. \\n\\nBut, instead of arranging a anonymous trip to Rijker's for him, they played on his venality and came to a mutually beneficial arrangement: he would become their creature, especially of the van de Kuypers faction. He would use his considerable skills to protect their interests in the Burgerhof, and they would see he enjoyed the perquisites he had always wanted. For the past seven years, he has served them well. \\n\\n	true
